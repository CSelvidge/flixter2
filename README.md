# README

Using Ruby 2.6.3 and Rails 5.2.3

This project seperated users into Student and Teacher, uses the cloud to store videos, and handles course enrollment via Stripe. Flixter uses a much more complex database that allows teachers to order their courses into lessons and each lesson can have on-the-fly ordered sections via Javacript interactions. Students may only view the videos on courses they are enrolled in.

The site is designed to accept stripe test card 4242 4242 4242 4242 with any valid experation date and CCV.
